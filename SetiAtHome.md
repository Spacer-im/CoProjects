# Introduction

SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, is an exploratory science that seeks evidence of life in the universe by looking for some signature of its technology.

Our current understanding of lifeâ€™s origin on Earth suggests that given a suitable environment and sufficient time, life will develop on other planets. Whether evolution will give rise to intelligent, technological civilizations is open to speculation. However, such a civilization could be detected across interstellar distances, and may actually offer our best opportunity for discovering extraterrestrial life in the near future.

One approach, known as radio SETI, uses radio telescopes to listen for narrow-bandwidth radio signals from space. Such signals are not known to occur naturally, so a detection would provide evidence of extraterrestrial technology.

# About the project

[SETI@home](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) is a scientific experiment that uses Internet-connected computers in the SETI. You can participate by running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data.

Radio telescope signals consist primarily of noise (from celestial sources and the receiver's electronics) and man-made signals such as TV stations, radar, and satellites. Modern radio SETI projects analyze the data digitally. More computing power enables searches to cover greater frequency ranges with more sensitivity. Radio SETI, therefore, has an insatiable appetite for computing power.

Previous radio SETI projects have used special-purpose supercomputers, located at the telescope, to do the bulk of the data analysis. In 1995, David Gedye proposed doing radio SETI using a virtual supercomputer composed of large numbers of Internet-connected computers, and he organized the SETI@home project to explore this idea. SETI@home was originally launched in May 1999.

# How I can help

Many of us have various not often used computers in home or offices (media centers as an example). So you can share this idle computer power and help the SETI project just download and run the application.

**[Participate in SETI@home](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/sah_participate.php)**

But if you are a developer, then you can help with optimization and porting of the software for various platforms. This way you will help to expand the area where SETI@home can be running.
How about your smart TV?
