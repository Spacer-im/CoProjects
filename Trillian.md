# About the project

[Trillian](http://trillianverse.org/) is a project whose aim is to bridge the gap between astrophysical models and the vast amount of publicly available astronomical data.

Astronomy produces extremely large data sets from ground-based telescopes, space missions, and simulation. The problem is that no institution can host all of this data, let alone have the resources to properly manage it. The result is that applying analyses against full data sets across the wide range of wavelengths available is either beyond the resources of most astronomers or currently impossible. Trillian will make this simple and straightforward.

A primary component of how this will be accomplished is through a distributed, scalable computation engine. An astronomer need only supply a model — in physical units — as a small piece of code and submit it to Trillian. The engine will then apply this model against all data available. The user will not need to worry about the details of where the data is or even where the computation is taking place.

Trillian is being designed with modern methods of data access and handling on a large scale (and even expects to push the envelope in this space).
