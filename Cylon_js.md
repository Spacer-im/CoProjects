## About the project

[Cylon.js](https://cylonjs.com/) is a JavaScript framework for robotics,
physical computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

It provides a simple, but powerful way to create solutions
that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices concurrently.

Cylon.js has an extensible system for connecting to hardware devices.
It currently supports many robotics and physical computing systems, and software [platforms](https://cylonjs.com/documentation/platforms/).
In addition to the officially supported platforms, their users have created more platforms.
